    <p><img src="images/cbbrHands.jpg" align="right" class="inlineImageA">Here at Clean Burning Black Rocks Inc, we are committed to finding cleaner, more efficient methods of burning fossil fuels in an era that is increasingly dependent on clean, renewable energy. Our use of the proprietary Clean Burning Black Rock™ has revolutionized the fossil fuel industry and is driving our competitors to strive for better and cleaner methods of burning. We are so far ahead of the curve that the industry is really feeling the heat!</p>
    <p>Clean Burning Black Rocks Inc. originally started as a small company in Portland, Oregon, using standard, “dirtier” methods of producing electricity. Despite minor suits from the local civilian population, the climate proved suitable for a startup energy provider. There, the founder and CEO of Clean Burning Black Rocks Inc, Dr. Johnson Long began research on a new, more efficient form of coal that was more efficient, produced less carbon byproduct, and was easier to use industrially. After five years, endless nights of research, and nearly going bankrupt, Dr. Long finally made the ultimate breakthrough, and the Clean Burning Black Rock™ was born!</p>
    <p>Today our company has expanded across international borders. Our first non-domestic venture is based in Vietnam. The plant is completely self-sufficient powering our facility with our very own Clean Burning Black Rocks and local volunteers recruited from the nearby villages! We even stimulate the local infrastructure by bringing our renowned security partners, Academi, to help secure not only our facilities, but the villages of our workers as well. We also provide schooling to the local population in modern and progressive ideas, as well as proper and safe usage of our amazing product line of Clean Burning Black Rock™ to make it even easier for our loved employees to integrate with our new Clean Burning Black Rock™ future!</p>
    <p>Clean Burning Black Rocks Inc, now being a widely known and loved corporation based in the United States, has turned many of its financial resources to helping end the energy crisis both in the U.S. and abroad. Clean Burning Black Rocks Inc. is frequently contracted by the U.S. and Chinese government to help on large scale energy conversion and carbon-reduction projects. There are even rumblings among the scientific community that the Clean Burning Black Rock™ may be the key, illusive, component needed to unlock the secrets to nuclear fusion for all of mankind! Clean Burning Black Rocks Inc already owns the trademark for this amazing development as well. It’s known as Clean Burning Black Fusion™ and the first public tests of are system are set to premiere at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located in Saint Genis Pouilly, France, are planned for 2020!</p>

    <h1 class="bpHeader">Meet Dr. Johnson Long, Founder and CEO</h1>
    <p><img src="images/johnsonLongHeadShot.png" align="left" class="inlineImageB">For Sir Dr. Johnson Long, who was recently knighted by Queen Elizabeth II of England, this is a dream come true.</p>
    <p>“My father, Cave, was a scientist through and through until the day he died. I grew up always in awe of his achievements, and dreamed of the day that I would be able to join him in his endeavors. Unfortunately, he died before that day would come. I vowed that I would become a man he would be proud of, one that he felt could fill his shoes after he had gone.” Dr. Long said in an interview with NASA, who are planning on putting the Clean Burning Black Rock™ on their next Voyager satellite as a milestone of human achievement. He certainly has led the company in a direction that his father could truly be proud of.</p>
    <p>Clean Burning Black Rocks Inc. will remain committed to providing clean energy for its constituents and will continue to be leading humanity in the search for true renewable energy that will bring humanity to a new technological age.</p>
