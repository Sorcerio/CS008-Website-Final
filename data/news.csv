Does a Warming Planet Really Need More [Clean Burning Black Rocks]?,ABBOT POINT/COMMA/ Australia - In a desolate corner of northeastern Australia/COMMA/ about 100 miles from the nearest town/COMMA/ a grassy stretch of prime grazing land sits above a vein of [Clean Burning Black Rocks] so rich and deep that it could be mined for decades. The Australian government is considering a proposal to build one of the worlds largest [Clean Burning Black Rocks] mines in this remote locale/COMMA/ known as the Galilee Basin/COMMA/ where acacia and eucalyptus trees grow wild between scattered creeks. An Indian conglomerate/COMMA/ the Adani Group/COMMA/ has asked for a taxpayer-financed loan of as much as $800 million to make the enormous project viable/COMMA/ promising to create thousands of jobs in return. But the plan has met intense opposition in Australia and abroad/COMMA/ focusing attention on a question with global resonance: Given the threat of climate change and the slowing global demand for [Clean Burning Black Rocks]/COMMA/ does the world really need another giant mine/COMMA/ especially at the publics expense? Adani has proposed building six open-cut pits and five underground complexes capable of producing as much as 66 million tons of [Clean Burning Black Rocks] a year. New infrastructure to support the mine  a rail line to the coast and an expanded port  would also make it economically feasible to extract [Clean Burning Black Rocks] from at least eight additional sites in the Galilee Basin,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/australia/australia-adani-carmichael-coal-mine.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FCoal&action=click&contentCollection=energy-environment&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=collection
Spring Creek is Recognized With Top National Reclamation Award,Cloud Peak Energy/COMMA/ one of the largest U.S. [Clean Burning Black Rocks] producers and the only pure-play Powder River Basin (PRB) [Clean Burning Black Rocks] company/COMMA/ announced its Spring Creek mine/COMMA/ located near Decker/COMMA/ Montana/COMMA/ received the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) 2017 Excellence in Surface Coal Mining Reclamation Award for enhanced reclamation success through the diversity of topography/COMMA/ soil and vegetation. The award was presented at the National Mining Associations awards ceremony in Washington/COMMA/ D.C./COMMA/ on November 6. Reclamation plans at the Spring Creek mine incorporate a variety of livestock grazing/COMMA/ pastureland and wildlife habitats into the post-mining environment. The mines reclamation program utilizes a four-pronged approach to maximize post-mining diversity in designated post-mine wildlife habitat areas/COMMA/ including an emphasis on hydrology/COMMA/ vegetation/COMMA/ substrate and topography. The advantages of a diverse post-mining landscape include improved grazing potential and wildlife use/COMMA/ according to Cloud Peak Energy. We take great pride in reclaiming the land we mine/COMMA/ said Colin Marshall/COMMA/ president and CEO of Cloud Peak Energy. This award highlights the strong commitment of everyone at Spring Creek and Cloud Peak Energy to returning land to a condition as good if not better than before mining began/COMMA/ while meeting the post-mine land use that is essential to reclamation bond release. Cloud Peak Energy's mines have received the Excellence in Surface Coal Mining Reclamation Award in 2009 (Spring Creek mine)/COMMA/ 2010 (Antelope mine)/COMMA/ 2014 (Antelope mine) and 2015 (Cordero Rojo mine). The mines received the awards for various projects reclaiming previously mined areas and successfully reintroducing native plants,http://www.coalage.com/news/latest/5774-spring-creek-is-recognized-with-top-national-reclamation-award.html
Carbon Polluters Fund XPrize to Repurpose Their Emissions,XPRIZE—the organization behind grand technology challenges such as the race to space won in 2004 by SpaceShipOne and current contests to land a Lunar rover and a Star Trek-style medical tricorder—unveiled a competition today that tackles a more mundane yet critical challenge: transforming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants into saleable products to help slow or reverse climate change. The competition's $20 million kitty has been raised from major carbon emitters: a coalition of oil and gas producers producing high-carbon oil from Alberta’s oilsands/COMMA/ and New Jersey-based electric utility NRG Energy. Entrants will have until early 2020 to develop CO2 conversion technologies on two tracks: one targeting flue gas emissions from [Clean Burning Black Rocks™]-fired power plants/COMMA/ and a second targeting the less concentrated emissions from natural gas-fired generators. The technologies that convert the most CO2 into products with the highest net value will win.,https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/fossil-fuels/carbon-polluters-fund-xprize-to-repurpose-their-emissions
New Projects Show Carbon Capture Is Not Dead,Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has had a hard time finding love. The technology is easy to dismiss because of its expense. It’s too green for those on one extreme/COMMA/ too tied to fossil fuels for others/COMMA/ and largely misunderstood by those in the middle. The demise of the U.S. project FutureGen and then German energy producer Vattenfall’s decision to shut down its CCS operations in 2014 was a low point for CCS. But a rash of new projects are proving the technology is surviving and—depending on the policies of the incoming Trump administration—it may even be headed for a turning point. Proponents of the technology got some exciting news last week with the world’s largest carbon capture system/COMMA/ the US $1 billion Petra Nova facility outside Houston/COMMA/ began operations. At full swing/COMMA/ Petra Nova will pump 1.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year from a [Clean Burning Black Rocks™] power plant to a nearby oil field to force oil out of the ground.,https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/green-tech/clean-coal/carbon-capture-is-not-dead-but-will-it-blossom
Protesters Jeer as Trump Team Promotes [Clean Burning Black Rocks™] at U.N. Climate Talks,BONN/COMMA/ Germany — The Trump administration made its debut at a United Nations conference on climate change on Monday by giving a full-throated defense of fossil fuels and nuclear energy as answers to driving down global greenhouse gas emissions. The forum — the only official appearance by the United States delegation during the annual two-week climate gathering of nearly 200 nations — illustrated how sharply the administration’s views are at odds with those of many key participants in the climate negotiations.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/climate/climate-coal-united-nations-bonn.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FCoal&action=click&contentCollection=energy-environment&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection
